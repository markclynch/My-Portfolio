            I've always been fascinated by science and technology, mythology and
            fantasy and where those lines blur. <br />Developing on the web is
            my chance to be a magic-user while creating functional user friendly
            apps and webpages from seemingly thin air.

          <h5>Full stack developer</h5>
          <p>
            CannaClima is a side project I'm working on to help a small business
            in Oregon control the business logic in their greenhouses to boost
            both production and productivity. <br />
            <br />
            Using MongoDB, GraphQL, Express, Apollo, React and Node. Besides
            that I'm using some libraries to link the IoT devices to the cloud
            for ease of control and reporting. It's been an amazing experience I
            wouldn't trade for anything.

          <h5>Student Full Stack</h5>
          <p>
            After finishing the front end developer path with Free Code Camp I
            moved on to Team Treehouse to get more experience in things like
            SASS, React, Express and Nodejs.<br /><br />
            The visual approach packaged with coding tests and follow up chapter
            questions helped me to get a firm grasp of the basics.

          <h5>Student Front End</h5>
          <p>
            I owe a lot to FreeCodeCamp. When I was first looking into getting
            back into coding I did the obvious and searched boot camps,
            universities and rigid structured programs.<br /><br />
            Several factors made these unfeasable for my education. FCC was self
            paced, free and has a large welcoming community. It got me started
            writing code and I haven't stopped since.
